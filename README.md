# Charlie Dean's website

I made this website for myself. You could adapt it if you like and make something similar for you. But It's scary in there and I wouldn't reccomend it.

## Stack
Svelte, SvelteKit. Video.js. Uh... probably some other dependencies I can't recall.

## Windows

Every page at /routes/ has to export its own windowMeta-- this is used by the WindowManager to handle routing and the like.
