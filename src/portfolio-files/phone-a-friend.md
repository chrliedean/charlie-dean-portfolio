Phone-A-Friend aims to facilitate spontaneous (and often awkward) conversations between strangers. When a user texts the number displayed on the piece, they're connected via the handset to a number selected at random from a pool of the piece's previous users.

From September 8, 2021 to Semtember 28, 2021, the piece was on display at the [Chicago Garden](https://ars.electronica.art/newdigitaldeal/en/where-we-emerge-exhibition/) of the [ARS Electronica festival](https://ars.electronica.art/news/en/).
