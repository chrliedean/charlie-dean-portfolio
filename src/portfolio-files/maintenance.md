*Maintenance* was my thesis piece for undergrad. An approximately 20' x 10' room was outfitted with ephemera required to maintain and service the *PipeNet,* an opaque infrastructure developed by the  Schlatt corporation.

I recall a childhood fascination with mundane infrastructural spaces that normally present themselves as off limits: the janitor’s closet, the elevator mechanical room, the storage closet. When these utilitarian spaces, designed to be invisible, presented themselves into my everyday life— a door left ajar, an authority figure retrieving something— a fascinating opportunity would emerge for the observation of a system larger than the individual. A set of protocols, rules, and designed objects serving a purpose that I didn’t have the capacity to understand.

So much of my work deals with this fascination for the systems, infrastructure, and artifacts of the built world. Using graphic signage, architectural intervention, and the modification of existing technology, I aim to call attention to our reliance on the norms of our constructed environment. We forget that the often obscure or esoteric mechanisms and standards of the world around us were built by people just like us. Are we in control of the infrastructure we’ve built, or does the infrastructure control us?

In "Maintenance," I explore both the allure and absurdity of these systems. Through a simulated maintenance room filled with ephemera, products, and chemicals from the fictitious Schlatt corporation, I invite viewers to consider the hidden mechanisms that enable and pervert our everyday lives. The room suggests the presence of a worker who has stepped out for lunch, leaving behind a space frozen in time. This worker maintains an installation of Schlatt’s PipeNet— an unnecessary and dangerous alternative to the internet powered by toxic fluids and gasses that transmit information.

In one sense, the space simulates the coincidence of accidental access, and enables the childlike drive for exploration of the forbidden. “What’s in there?” “How does that work?” “What does this button do?” In a world where our movements are often constrained by social convention, signage (“EMPLOYEES ONLY”), and surveillance technology, it can be exhilarating to imagine what lies beyond the boundaries we're given— the power contingent upon access to the spaces that maintain our everyday operations.

But this sense of agency is illusory. We've distanced ourselves from the risks and responsibilities of our own lives and safety through technical language and regulations. We take for granted the absurd, abstract, and technical risks we're willing to take for convenience and connection, often without fully understanding the consequences. We are willing, say, to cook on a Teflon pan to avoid our eggs sticking— because the risks of doing so have been presented to us as unavoidable and commonplace, yet impossibly complicated. We are hopeless in the face of science and industry, beholden to the authorities who through impersonal, graphical, and bizarre language, dictate the acceptable uses of their incomprehensible achievements.

The average laborer may be subject to these risks every day, working with products subject to an extensive material safety data sheet providing a mix of tangible precautions (“wear a respirator”) and absurd proclamations (“contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer.”) We have developed a standardized pictographic system to indicate these hazards (“flammable,” “respiratory irritant,” “corrosive”) that aims not only to transcend language barriers but allow for quicker recognition of the hazard, and by extension, more prompt completion of the labor.

“Maintenance” is an interactive, satirical work that builds a scene from an alternate world that highlights these absurdities. What hazards will we subject ourselves to in the name of convenience? Why does an icon, like a red circle with a diagonal line, offer a greater impression of authority than the spoken word?

The controlled environment of "Maintenance" speaks to the lack of control we have over our lives in a broader sense. We subject ourselves to the illusion of personal agency— but the systems of the built world constrict this supposed freedom. What data will the computer understand? We must create information suitable for input into this system. What activities does this icon prohibit? We must behave in a manner deemed acceptable by the sign. Through industry, the internet, chemistry, and data science, our lives are governed by systems and algorithms we no longer have the capacity to understand.
