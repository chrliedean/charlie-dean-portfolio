This is an interactive projection piece I made at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. An image is projected on a wall-mounted circle which the viewer can freely rotate. Spinning the circle simulates the act of spinning a dryer drum containing me and some clothing. In the video below, a person interacts with the piece.
