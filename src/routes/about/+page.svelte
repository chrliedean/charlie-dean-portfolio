    Charlie Dean is an artist and fabricator originally from Baltimore, MD and currently living and working
     in Chicago, IL. A graduate of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, he received his BFA in 2023. 
     Working in sculpture, video, and various new media technologies, much of his work responds to the way

     Baltimore at the Creative Alliance.
